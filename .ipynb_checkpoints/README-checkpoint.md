## Background



Complete the following tasks:

1. [Sentiment Analysis](#Sentiment-Analysis)
2. [Natural Language Processing](#Natural-Language-Processing)
3. [Named Entity Recognition](#Named-Entity-Recognition)



### Instructions

#### Sentiment Analysis

Use the [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum and create a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin.

Use descriptive statistics to answer the following questions:

> Which coin had the highest mean positive score?
>   * Bitcoin has the higher mean positive score compared to ethereum, 0.074 vs. 0.065.
>
> Which coin had the highest negative score?
>    * Based on the descriptive statistics, Ethereum has the highest compound score.
>        * It topped at 0.90 vs. the maximum compound score of 0.79 from Ethereum. 
>    * On the other hand, Bitcoin has compound scores higher than Ethereum on 
>        * its average, minimum, 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles.
>
> Which coin had the highest positive score?
>    * Ethereum has the highest positive score with its maximum at 0.21 rather than the 0.14 received by Bitcoin.
>   
> _*Sentiments towards Ethereum are more volatile as the standard deviations are higher than those for Bitcoin*_
> _*on scores for compound, negative, neutral and positive texts.*_

#### Natural Language Processing

In this section, you will use NLTK and Python to tokenize the text for each coin. Be sure to:

1. Lowercase each word
2. Remove punctuation
3. Remove stop words

Next, look at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin.

1. Use NLTK to produce the ngrams for N = 2.
2. List the top 10 words for each coin.

Finally, generate word clouds for each coin to summarize the news for each coin.

#### Named Entity Recognition

In this section, you will build a named entity recognition model for both coins and visualize the tags using SpaCy.
